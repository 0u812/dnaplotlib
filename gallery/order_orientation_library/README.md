#Order and Orientation Library

<img src="order_orientation_library.png" width="400px"/>

This image shows a library of genetic circuits based on transcriptional repression.  Each logic gate consists of one or more regulable promoters driving an expression cassette, which consists of a ribozyme, RBS, CDS, and terminator.  The coding sequence (CDS) encodes a repressor, which binds a cognate promoter.  Regulatory interactions indicated arcs are the basis of NOR/NOT logic computations.

The monocistronic layout insulates expression at the 5' and 3' ends of the expression cassette, so circuit function is predicted to be independent of order and orientation of each cistron.  This library shows a series of order/orientation variants for the same genetic circuit, which may exhibit different performance due to genetic context effects.
